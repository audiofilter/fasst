## About the documentation

There are 3 main parts in the documentation:
1. The main page, which is README.markdown
2. The related pages, which are markdown files located in doc/
3. The pages generated by _doxygen_ from the comments in the code

To generate the documentation, simply hit `make doc` in the build/ directory. The HTML files will be located in build/doc/html/. You will need a recent version of _doxygen_ (available here: [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html)).

## About code formatting

I don't have any opinion about code formatting. I just want it to be consistent, so that it is readable. In order to avoid wasting time formatting the code manually, I use the _clang-format_ tool (available with the whole LLVM distribution here: [http://llvm.org/releases/download.html](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html)) which formats the code automatically.
